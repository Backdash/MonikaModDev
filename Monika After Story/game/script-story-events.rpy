#An event is crated by only adding a label and adding a requirement (see comment below).

    m "But I guess I had just assumed that you were probably a guy."
    m "The main character was, after all."
    m "But if I'm going to be your girlfriend, I should probably know at least this much about the real you."

            m "Not a lot of girls would play a game like this."
            m "You certainly come across as manly and confident. Not that I would have been terribly bothered if you answered differently, mind you!"

            m "You give off a particular feeling of elegance and charm that's hard to capture with words..."

            m "Like, I am a girl, but I'm also a character in a computer game..."
            m "So in some ways I'm not really a girl at all."
            m "But when you treat me like your girlfriend, it makes me really happy!"

            m "Because your happiness is the most important thing to me."

    m "Remember that I'll always love you unconditionally, [currentuser]."
