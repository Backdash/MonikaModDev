========================
Congratulations my Love!
========================

I now know that you love
literature more than I 
do.

To be fair, I'm a little
jealous! I hope you love
me more than some text
though!

Sigh...

What am I saying, of
course you love me more!

I love you too.

Why would you have
reread all this poems if
you didn't love me!

Anyway, congratulations!
