# Testing Flow / Bug Testing
This is a separate section from the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Backdash/MonikaModDev/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. It will contain a small guide on testing things you wish to implement for bugs & other issues, which is crucial to do before submitting a Pull Request to the repository. 

## Setting Up
### The Tools
Can't work without tools, right? Here's a list of simple but effective tools you can use for testing & fixing bugs. 

#### Text Editors
[Atom](https://atom.io/) - One of the most prominent text editors used by MAS contributors, *Atom* has many tools & features that allow for efficient and clean work on files that are being edited. It even has tools for *fixing merge conflicts.* 

#### Required Tools
[Ren'Py](https://renpy.org/) - Ren'Py is required for running the source code outside of a released version, which is needed for testing things you wish to add for bugs & other issues.
